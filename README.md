# AWS Cloud Infrastructure & Networking Capstone

## 🏢 Business Scenario: Cloud Migration for Caduceus Inc.
**Caduceus Inc.** is an organization transitioning from traditional on-premises virtualization to a scalable cloud-based infrastructure. This project serves as a "Proof of Concept" (PoC) to demonstrate how AWS services can meet their business needs.

**The Mission:**
* **Compute:** Migrate legacy workloads to AWS EC2 (Windows & Linux).
* **Storage:** Implement high-durability S3 object storage and shared EFS network storage.
* **Networking:** Design a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with isolated subnets for different departments.
* **Security:** Use RSA keys and Security Groups to protect corporate assets.
## 📋 Project Overview
This project documents the end-to-end provisioning of a secure cloud environment on AWS for a simulated corporate migration. It covers virtual machine deployment, identity management, shared storage architecture, and VPC networking.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
* **Compute:** Provisioning Ubuntu Linux & Windows Server 2022 via EC2.
* **Storage:** Configuring Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) and S3 buckets.
* **Networking:** Designing VPC subnets and calculating CIDR blocks.
* **Security:** Implementing Security Groups (Firewalls) and RSA Key Pair authentication.
* **Troubleshooting:** Resolving NFS mount timeouts and SSH protocol errors.

## 🚀 Highlights from the Report
* **Network Isolation:** Designed a VPC with specific CIDR ranges to ensure private resource security.
* **Shared Storage:** Successfully mounted an EFS volume across instances and validated with a 1GB test file.
* **Platform Analysis:** Conducted a comparative study of AWS, Azure, and GCP to justify the infrastructure choice.
